# INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING UDACITY COURSE

In this repo you will find the resources I  used for the [intro to machine learning course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120).

---
The python version used for the course was the recommended by Udacity, _python2.7_. All the packages can be installed by:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I actually experienced a runtime error with the matplotlib library as i was working in MAC OSX indicating python wasn't installed as a framework. This was solved with the following command:
```bash
echo "backend: TkAgg" >> ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc 
```

Note that you can't use this repo directly as the dataset isn't downloaded on it.
